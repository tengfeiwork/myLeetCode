## Overview:
Record my LeetCode solution code & explaination.

If necessery, the process of solving problem will be recorded too.

Those codes may not be the best method, some of them even worse, but shows the first impression and the only method I can work out when I meet those questions. 

Although, under the limit knowledge of C++ , some questions can't be solved by myself, so, I copied some answers which from other authors used to learn purpose. I'll try to mark those code, but if I missed some of them, please kindly mention me. Thanks.
